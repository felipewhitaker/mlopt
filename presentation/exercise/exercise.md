# Machine Learning Under a Modern Optimization Lens

## Neural Networks

### Fully Connected Neural Networks

Choose a non-linear function and generate train and validation data . Define a neural network . Train the model . Store results between epochs . Plot loss x epochs . Judge the results . 

Judge generalization with data outside of the X domain .

Modify loss function with l1 or l2 parameter normalization . Judge loss x epochs . Judge Generalization .

Grow neural network . Change loss function to include normalization during training . Judge loss x epochs . Judge Generalization .

Include Residual Connections . Judge loss function .

### Convolutional Neural Networks

Consider the trained network . Test some of its predictions .

Consider the adversarial examples generated from given `function`

Fine tune the network to be more prepared to handle the adversarial networks .

### Recurrent Neural Networks

Choose a time series . Preprocess data . Prepare data to be given to a recurrent network . Compare test results to make predictions (step by step, sequence etc.).

Create disturbances in the initial data . Choose spread of predictions . Talk about generalization .
