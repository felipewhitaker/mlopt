# Machine Learning Under a Modern Optimization Lens

This repository is the result of a semester at a [PUC-Rio](https://www.puc-rio.br/index.html)'s course by the same name of the book [Machine Learning Under a Modern Optimization Lens](https://www.dynamic-ideas.com/books/machine-learning-under-a-modern-optimization-lens).

Every class was given by a student over one chapter and had an exercise for fixation. My solutions for them can be found under [`./exercises/`](./exercises/). Both the classes and exercises are in brazilian portuguese, but the code was written in english. Some exercises required data, which can be downloaded using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/).

For example, I gave a lecture on Neural Networks to give context for the chapter on Neural Networks transformed into Optimal Trees. The presentation can be found under [`./presentation/mlopt-nn.pdf`](./presentation/mlopt-nn.pdf). The exercise can be found under [`./presentation/exercise/exercise.md`](./presentation/exercise/exercise.md). The code for some of the examples used in the presentation can be found under [`./presentation/code/`](./presentation/code/).

If you have any doubt or suggestion, don't hesitate on contacting me.
